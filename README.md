# Preprocessing-and-analysis-of-FANTOM5-CAGE-profiles
(1) CAGEr package was used to preprocess the CAGE peaks including mapping, annotation, and resulting in the gene expression matrix which was used for the analysis.<br />
(2) DESeq2 package was used to perform differential expression analysis for each of ADMSCs, NSCs, and Neuorns vs. the background samples. Details of profiled samples are included in Table S1.<br />
