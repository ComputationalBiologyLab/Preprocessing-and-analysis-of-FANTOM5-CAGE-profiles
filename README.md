# Preprocessing-and-analysis-of-FANTOM5-CAGE-profiles
1) CAGEr package was used to annotate the CAGE peaks and provide the gene expression matrix.<br /> 
(2) DESeq2 package was used to perform differential expression analysis of each of ADMSCs, NSCs, and Neuorns vs. the background cell types.
The case study used here is differentiation from human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) to neurons, through neural stem cells (NSCs) as a transition cell type.
